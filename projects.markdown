## 🌐 Projects

  
### Project 1: **Line Follower Robot**
A line follower robot is an autonomous vehicle that tracks a visual line or path on the ground, using sensors to detect and interpret the line’s presence. The robot’s movement is controlled by the line’s position, allowing it to follow the path accurately.
- **Technologies Used**: Arduino Uno, Arduino IDE
  

### Project 2: **Smart Gesture Gloves**
Smart gesture gloves are wearable devices that enable users to control electronic devices and machines using hand and arm gestures. These gloves are equipped with various pressure/flex sensors which track finger and hand movements, as well as recognize gestures.
- **Technologies Used**: Arduino Nano, Arduino IDE
